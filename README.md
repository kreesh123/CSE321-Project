Automated Light Swtich - README

Overiview
We will be implementing a design for an automated light switch. This switch is meant to help a person financially by automatically turning the lights on if it senses motion and turning the lights off by checking after a certain amount of time. The sensor will check after some time is there is still motion in the room, if there is, then the room will stay lit for the allotted amount of time, if there is no movement, the lights will turn off themselves.  

 

Motion can be any movement the sensor recognizes. The user can manually turn off the lights and turn them on if they want to override the sensor. This is meant to help save money by not having the lights left on when no one is in the room, assisting the user financially.
